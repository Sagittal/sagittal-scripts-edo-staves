===Sagittal notation===
In the following diagrams, "<symbol> = ~<comma>" (with an equals sign) means "<symbol> represents the tempering of <comma> which it exactly represents in JI", while "<symbol> ≈ ~<comma>" (with an approximately equals sign) means "<symbol> represents the tempering of <comma> which it approximately represents in JI".
This notation uses the same sagittal sequence as [[59-EDO#Sagittal notation|59-EDO]], and is a superset of the notations for EDOs [[22-EDO#Sagittal notation|22]] and [[11-EDO#Sagittal notation|11]].
