// TODO: Snapshot test will completely lock things down, 
// so that if I so much as change a char in a title or move a symbol by an octal left or right, I'll know about it. 
// So only intended changes to the notations will occur from here on out.
// will need to make sure gen-all spits out the input sentence, as well as the title, etc.
// I think having it capture the final SVGs would be a bit too far
